# Learning Go

Welcome to my Go (Golang) learning repository! 🎯  
This repo documents my journey into Go through hands-on exercises, small projects, and notes.

## 📚 Contents

Here's what you'll find in this repo:

- `basics/` – Syntax, types, control flow, functions
- `structs-interfaces/` – Working with structs, interfaces, and methods

## 🚀 Why I'm Learning Go

Go is a powerful, modern systems language that combines simplicity with performance. I'm exploring it to:

- Understand strong typing and compile-time safety
- Write efficient concurrent programs
- Build lightweight web services and tools
